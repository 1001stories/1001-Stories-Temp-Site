Welcome to the work-in-progress page of 1001stories.org, a home for our voices on water and climate change.

This sound map includes reflections and observations about changes in our environment, stories that capture our favorite water-related memories, and of course, oral his(and her, and gender non-binary)story. 

Click on a place to listen and learn about how water and climate change silently impact us all.

The personal is political is ecological. 

More soon, 
Devi & the 1001Stories team
